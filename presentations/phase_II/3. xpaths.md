# Custom XPaths

## HTML

HTML provides the structure to a website. 
- HTML uses tags to identify a line of HTML code
	- Tags can have Attributes and values to make them more unique or group them together. See the button tag below with the attribute and value id="submit"
- HTML tags are based on a family hierarchy. In the example below, HTML would be the parent to the HEAD and BODY tags, the HEAD and BODY tags would be siblings. 

``` html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

	<head>
		<title>Document</title>
	</head>

	<body>
		<h1>Welcome to the Website</h1>
		<h2>This is a test site</h2>
		<div>
			<button id="submit">Learn more</button>
		</div>
	</body>

</html>
```

<br>

Document Object Model (DOM) shows this hierarchy very clear. 
``` 
html
	head
		title=Document
	body
		h1=Welcome to the Website
		h2=This is a test site
		div
			button=Learn more
```

## Different types of Element Selectors

css selector
``` javascript
$('.submit-inputs') // if class="submit-inputs"
$('#submit') // if id="submit"
```
link text
``` javascript
$('button=Start today') // if <button>Start today</button>
```

partial link text
``` javascript
$('button*=Start') // if <button>Start today</button>
```
tag name
``` javascript
$('button') // if <button>Start today</button>

```
xpath example
``` javascript
$('//button[text()="Start today"]') // if <button>Start today</button>
$('//button[contains(text(), "Start")]') // if <button>Start today</button>
```

## Creating XPaths

Choosing to copy the xpath from Chrome Dev Tools is handy, but usually only for static websites. For dynamic websites, it is best to create custom xpaths so that the locations do not change often. Below we will show you how to build custom xpaths. It is best to start in finder in Chrome Dev Tools and make sure you find the element. 

<br>

Syntax
``` html
<tag attribute="value">Text</tag> <!--a line of HTML code-->

//tag[@attribute="value"] <!--xpath query by the tag, attribute and value-->
//tag[contains(@attribute, "value")] <!--xpath query by the tag and text value-->
//tag[contains(text(), "Text")] <!--xpath query by the tag and text value-->
```

<br>

Absolute path (/) can be used when stating an exact path from an element.
``` html
/html/body <!-- from html to direct child body --> 
```

<br>
Relative path (//) is used to find an element any where on the page where the condition is true. This can be combined with the absolute path by finding the relative path first. 

``` html
//*[@id="form"]/button <!-- from any tag with the id "form", go to the direct child button  --> 
```

<br>

Parent (..) is used to go up a node from where you are. For example, if a label tag is a child node to the button tag you want to click, then find the label tag, and go up a level to the button.
``` html
<button>
	<label>Submit</label>
</button>

//label[text()="Submit"]/.. <!-- from any label tag with the text "Submit", go up to the parent level --> 
```

<br>

Preceding-sibling is used to choose the sibling ahead of the node you found. 
``` html
<div>
	<input></input>
	<label>First Name</label>
</div>

//label[text()="First Name"]/preceding-sibling::input <!-- from any label tag with the text "First Name", go up to the input tag before it --> 
```

<br>

Following-sibling is used to choose the sibling after the node you found. 
``` html
<div>
	<label>First Name</label>
	<input></input>
</div>

//label[text()="First Name"]/following-sibling::input <!-- from any label tag with the text "First Name", go up to the input tag after it --> 
```
