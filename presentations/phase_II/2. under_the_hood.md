# Under the hood of Webdriverio

## Webdriver protocol 
- Specifies how to remotely control browsers via APIs
- APis stand for Application Programming Interface. 
    - Key word is Interface. Its like the Steering wheel to the car. You dont need to know how the engine work, just accelerate, brake and steer.
    - You request information from APIs via HTTP or HTTPS using a verb and an endpoint, and the API responds with the information and a response code
    - Each Webdriver command has a different API verb and endpoint
        - https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver/#endpoints

// in spec

## logging
- The numbers to the far left are mapped to the session-testOrder
    - You can run tests against various operating systems. Each os would count as a different session.
    - test order is the order of executed tests
- keep track of test order: search for RUNNING in \<browser>
- see passed tests: search for PASSED in \<browser>
- see failed tests: search for FAILED in \<browser>
- phantom failed test: usually imported path related

``` javascript
[0-2] PASSED in chrome - /test/specs/a.smoke/smoke.homePage.spec.js
